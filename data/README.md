According to Our World in Data, "Death rates are measured as the number of deaths 
per 100,000 population from both outdoor and indoor air pollution. Rates are
age-standardized, meaning they assume a constant age structure of the population
to allow for comparisons between countries and over time." (https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution)
