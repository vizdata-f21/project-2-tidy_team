## One Sentence High-Level Goal

Create an interactive spatio-temporal visualization of worldwide deaths related to air pollution. 

## Description of our Goals and Motivation 

The goal of our Shiny App is to communicate the harmful effects of air pollution on the world through time by visually displaying the deaths caused by air pollution. Our interactive map will display the death rate (deaths per 100,000) in countries across the world from 1990 to 2017 caused by different types of air pollution (e.g. household air pollution from solid fuels and ambient particulate matter pollution). The motivation to create such an app is to effectively show the deadly effects of air pollution across the globe, potentially showing the inequitable harm on countries that have less resources to protect against air pollution. By consolidating the huge amount of data available in a concise and informative way, the need to address air pollution can be better understood by more people.

#### Shiny App User Interaction

The app will first display the map page, which is set as the first tab of the page, labeled “Map”. The second tab will be labeled “Info”, which will display a paragraph description of the summary of the data, where we got the data from, and the goals of the app. The third tab, labeled “Trends”, will display screenshots comparing different ranges of years that our time found particularly interesting to highlight. The Trends tab is meant to provide users an idea of the overarching observations of our map. See the appendix for the sketch of our interface and choices available for the user. Within the Map tab, the user will interact with a side menu, giving them the ability to select the type of pollution the map will display. Each type of pollution is associated with a different continuous color scale. The colors on the map will go from light to dark according to the death rate in the country (deaths per 100,000 people). 

The user will also have the option to choose a type of risk factor instead of type of air pollution in the side menu. We included this option to provide additional information about causes of death across the globe if the user wants to observe how deaths by other causes vary across the years and country. When selected, the map will instead show the number of deaths in the country by the risk factor. The types of risk factors are included in the appendix. After selecting the type of pollution/risk factor, the user selects whether or not the user wants to see death rates in an absolute scale or a log scale. After the map displays the colors according to the user’s selection, the user can further interact with the map by sliding the time slider located under the map to select a specific year to display, ranging from 1990 to 2017. We are also exploring animating the slider. On the map, the user can use their mouse to hover over each country, displaying a small box over the country that shows the name, GDP per capita, and death rate of the country.

Visual draft of our map can be found in the appendix.

#### Tools

We will be using the [leaflet package](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) to create our interactive map. Although we could geom_polygon for this process, we wanted to explore a new package and look into something that we have not learned in class yet. The leaflet package will enable us to make the map interactive in the sense that not only will the user be able to zoom and view country labels, but we can also add markers for locations of importance and add various other layers to our map. 

### Data Description

Our dataset involves five different imported csv files. The first csv file includes the rate of death by air pollution type and by country from 1990 to 2017 - `r ncol(death_rates_from_air_pollution)` variables and `r nrow(death_rates_from_air_pollution)` observations. The second csv file simply includes the rate of death by country from 1990 to 2017, regardless of air pollution type - `r ncol(death_rates_total_air_pollution)` variables and `r nrow(death_rates_total_air_pollution)` observations. According to the data source, death rates are standardized to account for the differences in distributions of ages of populations between countries. so that countries can be directly compared. The third csv file includes the number of deaths by risk factor (unsafe water, unsafe sanitation, no access to hand wash, household air pollution, Non-exclusive breast feeding, discontinued breast feeding and child wasting etc.) and by country from 1990 to 2017 - `r ncol(number_deaths_by_risk_factor)` variables and `r nrow(number_deaths_by_risk_factor)` observations. The fourth csv file includes the proportion of deaths attributed to air pollution in countries from 1990 to 2017 -  `r ncol(death_rates_from_air_pollution)` variables and `r nrow(share_deaths_air_pollution)` observations. The fifth csv file includes the annual GDP per capita for each country in current USD from 1990 to 2017 - `r ncol(gdp_by_country)` variables and `r nrow(gdp_by_country)` observations. There is some missing data for some countries in the 1960s and 1970s but the vast majority of observations are complete so this dataset will suffice; however, limitation will be clearly noted in the shiny model. Perhaps we will include a tab that details missing data points so the user understands limitations.

7  Week 7 of project (week of Mon, Nov 29): Conduct another round of peer review.
  + Incorporate the visualization into the shiny app (All of us with collaborate).
  + Ideally, we would like to have the coding part of our project done by the beginning of this week. That would give us the rest of the week to reflect, make any final touches, and plan for the presentation. 
  + Make any final touches. (All)
  + Create presentation and prepare for in-class presentation (We will assign someone to take lead on this later on.) 

8. Write-up and presentation: due *Fri, Dec 3 at noon* (beginning of class).

### Weekly Meeting Date and Time 

We plan to have our scheduled meetings weekly on Wednesdays before lecture. We will decide how early to start before class based on how much work we anticipate needed to get through for the day.

## Repo Organization

The project is organized into 6 main folders: 

* `data`: includes our world air pollution datasets and the data dictionary.
* `images`: includes any images, logos, and gifs for our Shiny App.
* `proposal`: includes our Project 2 proposal files.
* `pollution_map`: contains our files that build to the Shiny App. This includes data wrangling and visualization steps, as well as the final shiny app files. We will include more sub folders into this folder as we build the app as needed.
* `presentation`: includes our presentation files.
* `exploratory_work` : includes any initial exploratory data analysis, visualizations, or other attempts at our project. We intend to delete this folder before the project is complete, but are using it now as a workspace.

Finally, while we initially brainstormed the idea for a Shiny app on air pollution ourselves, we found through additional research that there were [similar concepts](https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution) already created by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser with Our World in Data. While both our shiny app and their visualizations will include interactive world maps, we think that ours is unique in that we will have check boxes depending on the data the user wants to see. From what we have seen online so far, it seems as though different maps are created for different data (there is no centralized map with check boxes for the data that is to be viewed). Additionally, we are hoping to include GDP information in our map, which we do not think is already done as differences in incomes of countries appears to just be mentioned in text, not the visualization.

## Data Reference 

Although accessed via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavan9065/air-pollution), the data's original source is [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution), which is a public data collection initiative led by the nonprofit Global Change Data Lab. The nonprofit shares knowledge (and data) about the world's most pressing issues so that anyone has the tools and information they need to work toward combating a particular global problem. Our World in Data notes that their data sources include the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (Global Burden of Disease)](http://www.healthdata.org/results/data-visualizations) and [State of Global Air](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/data) The data was posted to Kaggle about a month ago and includes data spanning the years 1990 to 2017.

We found GDP per capita data for each country over the years of interest via the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2017&start=1990). It appears from the bank's website that the data was collected via World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) databases.
